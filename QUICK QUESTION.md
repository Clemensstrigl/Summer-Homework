# Summer-Homework
APCS Summer Homerwork
I did have a question regarding the quizes after the problem sets because i reviewed my answers and some of them i got wrong because of
missed spaces, miss spelling, but it is still the correct answer
So I was wondering if that will bring down my grade or if the tests even matter?
